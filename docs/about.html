                <span class="byline">The Earth Observation Toolbox and Development Platform</span>
            </header>
            <p>BEAM is a platform facilitating a quick and easy development of great tools for the analysis and processing of Earth observation data.
                It comes with an extensible module framework and the intuitive VISAT graphical user interface. Several tools are included to employ
                the power of BEAM from the command line or within scripts.
                It's extensibility is well proven by diverse toolboxes and plugins, which have been built on top of BEAM. Some highlights are:
                CHRIS-Box, a toolbox for the hyperspectral CHRIS sensor onboard the ESA Proba platform
                Glob-Toolbox for the various ESA global projects
                NEST (Next ESA SAR Toolbox), the successor of BEST
                SMOS-Box, a toolbox for ESA's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission
                In addition, numerous BEAM extensions are available as plugins.

                    </header>
                    <p>The project SMOS Toolbox for BEAM (SMOS-Box) has been brought into life in order to support users of data acquired by ESA's
                        Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission.
                        BEAM and the SMOS-Box are user tools which ESA/ESRIN is providing free of charge to the Earth Observation Community. The
                        SMOS-Box software is developed by Brockmann Consult under ESA contract initiated by Steven Delwart (ESTEC) and coordinated by
                        Peter Regner (ESRIN).</p>

                    <p>The GlobToolbox project has the aim to migrate the existing ESA GlobToolbox 1.0 software to the BEAM platform.
                        The BEAM GlobToolbox 2.0 provides functions for the visualisation of various large data products of the DUE "Glob"-series of
                        projects, as well as for the generation, inspection and analysis of time series generated from these global data
                        products. </p>

                        <h2>Nest</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>The Next ESA SAR Toolbox (NEST) is used for visualising, analysing and post-processing the large amount of data from ESA SAR
                        missions, including heritage ERS-1 & 2, ENVISAT and future Sentinel-1. In addition, the handling of data acquired by missions
                        like JERS-1, ALOS PALSAR, TerraSAR-X, Radarsat-1 & 2 and Cosmo-Skymed will be supported.

                        NEST complements existing software packages and has been built on the BEAM Toolbox. It aims at replacing the  Basic Envisat
                        SAR Toolbox (BEST) and undergoes development with periodic releases. An integrated data viewer and orthorectification and
                        mosaicking of SAR images are new functions, which were not provided by BEST.</p>

                        BEAM and the CHRIS-Box are user tools which ESA/ESRIN are providing free of charge to the Earth Observation Community. The
                        CHRIS-Box software provides extensions for BEAM, which allow accomplishing the following tasks:<br>
                        Noise Reduction, Cloud Screening, Atmospheric Correction, Geometric Correction, TOA Reflectance Computation, Feature
                        Extraction

                <span class="byline">History of BEAM</span>
            </header>
            <p>BEAM was initiated under ESA contract in 2002. Being the first ESA open-source project, BEAM has undergone more than 20 release cycles
                and has evolved from a basic ENVISAT/MERIS toolbox to an accepted platform for the analysis and processing of Earth observation data
                in general.
                Since initiation more than 30 projects have been realised by Brockmann Consult, either alone or as corporate partner, which have made
                use of BEAM and have essentially driven the BEAM evolution. Many third parties use BEAM internally.
                Nowadays BEAM has a vital and growing user community, and has become an institution for many users and developers dealing with the
                analysis and processing Earth observation data.
